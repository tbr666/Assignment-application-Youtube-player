The miminum android version required to run this application is Android 4.4.2 (API  19). Note that the application needs
to be tested on a real device since some elements like YoutubePlayerView can't be rendered properly in emulator due to Android studio
bugs. Also note  that the application name for users is Youtube player but android project name is VideoLoader3
as a third version of application that managed to work properly.
